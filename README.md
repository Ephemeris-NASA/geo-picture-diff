show_the_difference.py - showing the difference between "before" state and "after" state. Basically, can show 
the difference in deforestation on a picture.

To run this put the "before" pictures in before directory and "after" in after directory. Both pictures gotta be in .tif
format and have the same naming, except after picture gotta have "_w" prefix. All the results will be placed in results 
directory

For instance: 
    - Before-state picture name -> chip_077_612_forest_nonforest.tif
    - After-state picture name -> chip_077_612_forest_nonforest_w.tif
